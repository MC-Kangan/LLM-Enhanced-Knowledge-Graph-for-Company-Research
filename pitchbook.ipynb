See the list below for our most frequently asked questions. If your question is not listed here, then please contact us. [Make It Easier to Run My Business](https://www.approveme.com/email-limited-pricing/)\\n\\nWP E-Signature is perfect for small business owners, designers, freelancers, photographers and basically anyone who’s tired of sending their customers to a third party website to sign their documents.If you want to get documents or contracts signed, then you need WPESign™.\\n\\nWP E-Signature is a self-hosted application that runs as a WordPress plugin. In order to use WP Esign, you must have a self-hosted WordPress website. That’s pretty much it.\\n\\nNo. WP E-Signature is a WordPress Online Contract and Document Signing Plugin, so it will not work on sites that are not using WordPress. Also, WPESign™ is not compatible with the WordPress.com platform. You need to have a self-hosted version of WordPress to use WP E-Signature.\\xa0What some of our non-WordPress customers have been doing is the following:\\xa01. They’ve set up a subdomain with their domain registrar with a name like esign. yourdomain.com\\xa02. Most web hosts nowadays offer FREE WordPress installation… so our users have been taking advantage of this and requesting their web host create a FREE WordPress install and then install our E-Signature plugin there. This means your users would only interface with the document signing portion of the software and you would simply log into the WordPress portion to create your contracts.\\n\\nMost definitely not. You can create, send, track and capture signatures on contracts without any coding experience. WPESign™is the most user-friendly WP E-Signature and contract generation plugin in the market.\\n\\nWith our\\xa0[🔗 Upload Logo and Branding](https://www.approveme.com/wpesign-features/upload-logo-branding/ \"Upload Logo and Branding\")\\n\\xa0add-on (Elite and Lifetime license), you can add your mark to E-Signature emails with your logo, tagline, a custom paragraph about your company, and even a cover page that will add your logo to your signed documents.\\xa0There will, however, still be a minimal amount of ApproveMe branding in WP E-Signature. It’s a delicate juggle because our goal is to build a UETA/ESIGN compliant platform that is recognized and trusted in the courtroom (much like DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.) so there needs to be a minimal amount of indication to a signer (and a judge) that a document was signed on our compliant platform… yet there needs to be enough customization that your brand/company is more front and center than the platform branding itself. The only ApproveMe-related image on a document page is the ‘verified seal’ and the only notification on the PDF is in the footer.\\n\\nYes, you can use WPESign™ on client sites. Either you can purchase a license on their behalf and use the license key for their site, or you can have your clients purchase a license and provide you access to their account. A valid license is required for access to support and updates and an ongoing relationship with your client is required to use WP E-Signature in this way. For more information about this, see\\xa0[section 11 of our Terms and Conditions](https://www.approveme.com/terms-conditions/ \"terms and conditions\")\\n.\\n\\nWe understand your concern for security. In fact, we share the same concern which is one of the many reasons we decided to create WP E-Signature. Our plugin is the first UETA/ESIGN compliant document signing WordPress plugin.\\xa0If you’re an avid reader and would love to learn more about the security of our plugin, here are a few helpful links for your reading pleasure:\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Audit Trail Security… how it works (and can protect your signers)](https://www.approveme.com/wordpress-audit-trail-e-signature-certificate/ \"Audit Trail Security\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Security of WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/security-ueta-e-sign-protection/ \"Security of WP E-Signature\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Additional documentation on plugin security](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article-category/security-and-compliants/ \"Additional documentation on plugin security\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[UETA/ESIGN Compliance](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act/ \"UETA/ESIGN Compliance\")\\n\\xa0In the early stages of WP E-Signature, a majority of our startup budget was allocated towards attorney fees, security experts, and security advisors to ensure that WP E-Signature is (and will remain) the most trusted document signing WordPress plugin on the market. We will continue to invest heavily in the security and legalities of the electronic signature industry as technology advances and changes.\\n\\nSince security is a HUGE concern of ours, WPESign™does not store signed documents on an FTP server. The signatures, custom input fields, document data, and audit trail events are all encrypted and stored in very strategic (and different) locations in your database. The contract itself is not stored on your FTP server (for security reasons).\\xa0While our plugin supports/generates PDF documents of a completed contract, it does so only on demand. This means a signer must have their unique signer invitation URL. And the document sender user must be logged in to download the PDF. If a WordPress administrator were to so much as attempt to unencrypt any data and change a period to a comma in your database, it would break the entire document and throw an “error document not found” message.\\xa0We pride ourselves in security and invest heavily in doing everything we can to protect our users and their signers (certainly more so than most WordPress plugins).\\xa0Once a document has been digitally signed the document contents are encrypted and stored in your database ([more about document security here](https://www.approveme.com/security-ueta-e-sign-protection/ \"document security\")\\n).\\xa0The document can be downloaded in a few different ways:\\xa01. The\\xa0[Document Sender Dashboard](https://www.approveme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/e-signature-sign-pdf.png \"Document Sender Dashboard\")\\n\\xa0lets you download archived documents as PDFs.\\xa02.

See the list below for our most frequently asked questions. If your question is not listed here, then please contact us. [Make It Easier to Run My Business](https://www.approveme.com/email-limited-pricing/)\\n\\nWP E-Signature is perfect for small business owners, designers, freelancers, photographers and basically anyone who’s tired of sending their customers to a third party website to sign their documents.If you want to get documents or contracts signed, then you need WPESign™.\\n\\nWP E-Signature is a self-hosted application that runs as a WordPress plugin. In order to use WP Esign, you must have a self-hosted WordPress website. That’s pretty much it.\\n\\nNo. WP E-Signature is a WordPress Online Contract and Document Signing Plugin, so it will not work on sites that are not using WordPress. Also, WPESign™ is not compatible with the WordPress.com platform. You need to have a self-hosted version of WordPress to use WP E-Signature.\\xa0What some of our non-WordPress customers have been doing is the following:\\xa01. They’ve set up a subdomain with their domain registrar with a name like esign. yourdomain.com\\xa02. Most web hosts nowadays offer FREE WordPress installation… so our users have been taking advantage of this and requesting their web host create a FREE WordPress install and then install our E-Signature plugin there. This means your users would only interface with the document signing portion of the software and you would simply log into the WordPress portion to create your contracts.\\n\\nMost definitely not. You can create, send, track and capture signatures on contracts without any coding experience. WPESign™is the most user-friendly WP E-Signature and contract generation plugin in the market.\\n\\nWith our\\xa0[🔗 Upload Logo and Branding](https://www.approveme.com/wpesign-features/upload-logo-branding/ \"Upload Logo and Branding\")\\n\\xa0add-on (Elite and Lifetime license), you can add your mark to E-Signature emails with your logo, tagline, a custom paragraph about your company, and even a cover page that will add your logo to your signed documents.\\xa0There will, however, still be a minimal amount of ApproveMe branding in WP E-Signature. It’s a delicate juggle because our goal is to build a UETA/ESIGN compliant platform that is recognized and trusted in the courtroom (much like DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.) so there needs to be a minimal amount of indication to a signer (and a judge) that a document was signed on our compliant platform… yet there needs to be enough customization that your brand/company is more front and center than the platform branding itself. The only ApproveMe-related image on a document page is the ‘verified seal’ and the only notification on the PDF is in the footer.\\n\\nYes, you can use WPESign™ on client sites. Either you can purchase a license on their behalf and use the license key for their site, or you can have your clients purchase a license and provide you access to their account. A valid license is required for access to support and updates and an ongoing relationship with your client is required to use WP E-Signature in this way. For more information about this, see\\xa0[section 11 of our Terms and Conditions](https://www.approveme.com/terms-conditions/ \"terms and conditions\")\\n.\\n\\nWe understand your concern for security. In fact, we share the same concern which is one of the many reasons we decided to create WP E-Signature. Our plugin is the first UETA/ESIGN compliant document signing WordPress plugin.\\xa0If you’re an avid reader and would love to learn more about the security of our plugin, here are a few helpful links for your reading pleasure:\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Audit Trail Security… how it works (and can protect your signers)](https://www.approveme.com/wordpress-audit-trail-e-signature-certificate/ \"Audit Trail Security\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Security of WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/security-ueta-e-sign-protection/ \"Security of WP E-Signature\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[Additional documentation on plugin security](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article-category/security-and-compliants/ \"Additional documentation on plugin security\")\\n\\xa0🔗\\xa0[UETA/ESIGN Compliance](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act/ \"UETA/ESIGN Compliance\")\\n\\xa0In the early stages of WP E-Signature, a majority of our startup budget was allocated towards attorney fees, security experts, and security advisors to ensure that WP E-Signature is (and will remain) the most trusted document signing WordPress plugin on the market. We will continue to invest heavily in the security and legalities of the electronic signature industry as technology advances and changes.\\n\\nSince security is a HUGE concern of ours, WPESign™does not store signed documents on an FTP server. The signatures, custom input fields, document data, and audit trail events are all encrypted and stored in very strategic (and different) locations in your database. The contract itself is not stored on your FTP server (for security reasons).\\xa0While our plugin supports/generates PDF documents of a completed contract, it does so only on demand. This means a signer must have their unique signer invitation URL. And the document sender user must be logged in to download the PDF. If a WordPress administrator were to so much as attempt to unencrypt any data and change a period to a comma in your database, it would break the entire document and throw an “error document not found” message.\\xa0We pride ourselves in security and invest heavily in doing everything we can to protect our users and their signers (certainly more so than most WordPress plugins).\\xa0Once a document has been digitally signed the document contents are encrypted and stored in your database ([more about document security here](https://www.approveme.com/security-ueta-e-sign-protection/ \"document security\")\\n).\\xa0The document can be downloaded in a few different ways:\\xa01. The\\xa0[Document Sender Dashboard](https://www.approveme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/e-signature-sign-pdf.png \"Document Sender Dashboard\")\\n\\xa0lets you download archived documents as PDFs.\\xa02.

In today’s business world, virtually every company is a software company—including banks, retailers, and other brick-and-mortar businesses that have been around for decades. Customer and employee interactions have dramatically shifted to digital spaces, putting the product experience at the center of the business. And when companies implement new digital tools, HR, IT, internal product managers, and change management leaders need to ensure successful digital adoption of the software.\\n\\nPendo exists to make digital experiences better, no matter what you make or sell to customers and no matter what tools you use for your employees.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWho can use the Pendo platform?\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nAnyone interested in improving the customer or employee experience can use Pendo. Examples of users by role include:\\n\\n*   Product teams\\n*   IT and business operations teams\\n*   Change management teams\\n*   Finance teams\\n*   Customer success teams\\n*   Marketing teams\\n*   HR teams\\n*   Sales teams\\n\\n> _**“Improving the world’s experiences with software”**_\\n> \\n> As a user, I always got frustrated if I found myself stuck while using a software product—maybe the page is slow to load, or the button isn’t where I expected it to be, or it’s missing a feature that I thought it had. These small moments can have a big impact on the user experience, and as a product person, I want to avoid my users feeling this type of frustration at all costs.\\n> \\n> But in order to know how to improve users’ experience with a product, you first need to understand how they’re using it, what they want from it, and which usage patterns lead to success. Not to mention be able to communicate this to them in a way that resonates and empowers customers to use the product to its fullest extent.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nHow does Pendo work?\\n--------------------\\n\\n![How does Pendo work?](https://www.pendo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pendo.io-Product-Experience-and-Digital-Adoption-Solutions.png)\\n\\nUnlike point solutions that address only analytics, or in-app guidance, or feedback, Pendo lets you do all this and more under a unified platform. The result is both cost savings and reduced digital friction resulting from toggling back and forth between multiple apps. Pendo’s all-in-one solution also means teams have a unified data set at their fingertips, with no risk of siloed data creating inefficiencies or blockers to driving product experience improvements and change.\\n\\n[The business case for product experience software](https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/the-business-case-for-product-experience-software/)\\n\\n[Read now](https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/the-business-case-for-product-experience-software/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWhat can you do with Pendo??\\n----------------------------\\n\\nPendo offers a comprehensive set of products for improving product and app experiences and driving better business outcomes in its all-in-one platform. These include:\\n\\n*   [**Analytics**](/product/analytics/)\\n    : Put simply, Pendo helps organizations understand whether the products and features they’re building for customers and buying for are being used and if so, by whom. With our product analytics capabilities, you can determine which features users embrace and ignore and how they navigate across your product portfolio. You can also see how product adoption varies based on account, user role, or user sentiment. Our goal is to provide product teams with the information they need to do their jobs better and make day-to-day decisions easier.\\n*   [**In-app Guidance**](/product/in-app-guides/)\\n    : In-app messages give Pendo’s customers a way to quickly and easily put the insights they gain from product analytics into action. In the end, this ability to experiment and drive behavior change within your product is truly what can improve your business and create better outcomes for your customers. By delivering customized support to customers in-app, teams can both get users to value fast, and continually improve and iterate on their onboarding and support motions.\\n*   **Listen**: Pendo Listen helps product teams build what users need, not features they’ll never use. It automates the gathering and prioritization of customer feedback, delivering data to build with confidence and avoid wasted R&D spend. Listen gathers user feedback in-app and via other sources, then analyzes this data alongside user behavior and other data to understand what features would be most valuable. This allows teams to focus on ideas that will have a real impact and avoid wasting time and resources on features that won’t be used.\\n*   [**Session Replay**](/product/session-replay/)\\n    : Video playbacks of user actions are a uniquely powerful tool in helping product teams understand why they do what they do. Gaining this kind of context on the customer experience helps direct internal teams to the right priorities through visual proof of user actions. Pendo lets you leverage unlimited replays, so you never have to miss a critical user interaction or insight. You can easily filter replays by both quantitative and qualitative data. You can also put customer privacy first: We offer three out-of-the-box, no-code settings that are fully customizable to your needs.\\n*   **SaaS portfolio insights**: Makes it easy to ensure you have the right tech for your team. With Pendo analytics and guides, you can encourage application and process adoption, and drive ROI across your entire organization. Pendo also lets IT teams drive internal alignment with a data-informed view of the employee experience. This usage data, among other things, allows teams to spot trends that inform IT strategy. It also allows IT to audit license utilization in order to identify underused areas or opportunities to consolidate. With Pendo, business operations teams can both reduce operational costs and increase productivity with strong business architecture.\\n*   **Validate**: A component of Pendo Listen, Pendo Validate helps teams build digital experiences they know customers will love and pay for. Not only can they add ideas to Pendo and set impact and effort ratings, they can also share up to three of those ideas with a segment of customers, in-app in order to get feedback on them. Pendo lets product teams conduct in-depth analysis of ideas based on votes, accounts, ARR, impact, and effort. The result is a streamlined discovery process that puts product teams in a position to drive wins for the business.\\n*   **Data Sync**: Pendo makes it easy for product teams to bring product data to the places where business decisions happen. Pendo product data can become a key source in BI data analysis without overloading data engineering teams. Teams can create a centralized source of truth by exporting and blending all product usage data in cloud storage. By joining product data with the full breadth of all key business data, orgs get deeper, more holistic insights into both customers and product motions. With Data Sync, every department — all the way up to the C-suite — speaks the same universal language of the business.\\n*   **Roadmaps:** A component of Listen, Pendo Roadmaps helps product teams align internal stakeholders and bring data into product planning. Pendo data helps teams share the “why” behind roadmap decisions to keep everyone aligned and motivated. Validating and visualizing the impact of features and initiatives on your roadmap in Pendo helps prove the value of product teams’ work. Pendo Roadmaps makes plans easy to adjust with new learnings and priorities and allows teams to link specific customer feedback requests to new initiatives and features.\\n*   **AI**: The power of Pendo AI stems from its massive data set based on trillions of data points and billions of daily interactions. These include clicks, swipes, poll responses, feedback requests, and guide views collected on behalf of 10,000 companies that use Pendo. Pendo AI also powers personalization, allowing you to supercharge your customer experience with automated, customized content delivered at the right time. Pendo AI also supercharges product discovery motions by analyzing, sorting, and identifying trends in data for faster customer insights.\\n*   **Mobile**: The Pendo platform helps create a user experience that engages customers across all screens. Product teams can build a seamless customer journey across mobile and desktop applications. Pendo gives teams the data they need to improve the mobile experience and guide them in-app without the need to release a new version.\\n*   **Integrations**: Pendo makes it easy to connect the power of its platform with the other tools you use every day, including CRM apps (Salesforce, [HubSpot](/integrations/hubspot/)\\n    ), collaboration tools (Okta, Slack), product tools (Figma, G2), business intelligence (BI) tools (Looker, Domo), and a host of other apps.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWhat are some ways in which businesses use Pendo?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBusinesses leverage Pendo for myriad use cases to drive a variety of outcomes. These include:\\n\\n*   **User onboarding:** Pendo lets you personalize user onboarding and training by leaning on your product to educate new users and guide them to success. Doing so allows onboarding teams to create a great first impression and delight new users with an intuitive digital experience from the very first login. It also lets them guide users to value, fast. In-app guides steer new users to—and enable them on—the features that will benefit them most. Segmentation and personalization capabilities can improve training and help users build proficiency and gain confidence.\\n*   **[In-app support](/glossary/in-app-messaging/)\\n    :** The Pendo platform helps users help themselves by providing them support in-app, when and where they need it. This kind of self-service support delivers better customer service solutions without human intervention, and thereby helps reduce support ticket backlogs. It also increases customer satisfaction.

Using analytics, they can understand how work happens today in order to plan the right change for tomorrow. Pendo also helps change leaders establish best practices, creating consistency and predictability in how they manage change in their organizations. For example, the platform’s rich analytics makes it easy to learn from the behavior of employees. By identifying and leveraging super users as change champions, teams can inform their support and guidance strategy based on how work actually happens among high performers.\\n*   **Product-led growth:** Pendo lets you drive growth and expand your product’s potential, at scale. Product teams can create a clear path to paid conversions by putting their product at the heart of go-to-market efforts. Making your product its own sales and marketing channel helps gain efficiency and build virality. The Pendo platform helps PLG teams reach the right audience by meeting users with personalized in-app communication, tailored to their needs.\\n*   **Product planning:** Pendo helps product teams understand what customers do—and why. With powerful analytics, they can get a clear line of sight into how users navigate and engage with features in order to best prioritize their resources. Pendo also lets teams better understand customer needs by collecting feedback at scale and segmenting it based on customer profile, revenue, and more. By understanding how users interact with freemium and paid products, product teams can know what to build next with Pendo data to back up their decisions.\\n*   **Product discovery**: Product discovery is the foundation for building successful products. It’s an iterative process where teams research and validate their ideas before diving into development.

In today’s business world, virtually every company is a software company—including banks, retailers, and other brick-and-mortar businesses that have been around for decades. Customer and employee interactions have dramatically shifted to digital spaces, putting the product experience at the center of the business. And when companies implement new digital tools, HR, IT, internal product managers, and change management leaders need to ensure successful digital adoption of the software.\\n\\nPendo exists to make digital experiences better, no matter what you make or sell to customers and no matter what tools you use for your employees.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWho can use the Pendo platform?\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nAnyone interested in improving the customer or employee experience can use Pendo. Examples of users by role include:\\n\\n*   Product teams\\n*   IT and business operations teams\\n*   Change management teams\\n*   Finance teams\\n*   Customer success teams\\n*   Marketing teams\\n*   HR teams\\n*   Sales teams\\n\\n> _**“Improving the world’s experiences with software”**_\\n> \\n> As a user, I always got frustrated if I found myself stuck while using a software product—maybe the page is slow to load, or the button isn’t where I expected it to be, or it’s missing a feature that I thought it had. These small moments can have a big impact on the user experience, and as a product person, I want to avoid my users feeling this type of frustration at all costs.\\n> \\n> But in order to know how to improve users’ experience with a product, you first need to understand how they’re using it, what they want from it, and which usage patterns lead to success. Not to mention be able to communicate this to them in a way that resonates and empowers customers to use the product to its fullest extent.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nHow does Pendo work?\\n--------------------\\n\\n![How does Pendo work?](https://www.pendo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pendo.io-Product-Experience-and-Digital-Adoption-Solutions.png)\\n\\nUnlike point solutions that address only analytics, or in-app guidance, or feedback, Pendo lets you do all this and more under a unified platform. The result is both cost savings and reduced digital friction resulting from toggling back and forth between multiple apps. Pendo’s all-in-one solution also means teams have a unified data set at their fingertips, with no risk of siloed data creating inefficiencies or blockers to driving product experience improvements and change.\\n\\n[The business case for product experience software](https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/the-business-case-for-product-experience-software/)\\n\\n[Read now](https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/the-business-case-for-product-experience-software/)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nWhat can you do with Pendo??\\n----------------------------\\n\\nPendo offers a comprehensive set of products for improving product and app experiences and driving better business outcomes in its all-in-one platform. These include:\\n\\n*   [**Analytics**](/product/analytics/)\\n    : Put simply, Pendo helps organizations understand whether the products and features they’re building for customers and buying for are being used and if so, by whom. With our product analytics capabilities, you can determine which features users embrace and ignore and how they navigate across your product portfolio. You can also see how product adoption varies based on account, user role, or user sentiment. Our goal is to provide product teams with the information they need to do their jobs better and make day-to-day decisions easier.\\n*   [**In-app Guidance**](/product/in-app-guides/)\\n    : In-app messages give Pendo’s customers a way to quickly and easily put the insights they gain from product analytics into action. In the end, this ability to experiment and drive behavior change within your product is truly what can improve your business and create better outcomes for your customers.

It doesn\\'t import previous addressees like the online version does, but the browser version pushes you to the app if you\\'re on mobile. Right now I have to send a picture of a document to get it signed because the app won\\'t load any documents at all. I can\\'t even tell you how often this app fails to notify me of a signature, either. Bad app.\\n\\n31 people found this review helpful\\n\\nThe process of creating a box, typing in a box, then dragging said box to fit the line of which you want the text to fill is overly inconvenient. That is one star. The ease of access that comes with doing something digitally is nonexistent. But at least it saves the trees as the app reminds us. One more star. Please make it auto detect where lines are at on a document\\n\\n63 people found this review helpful\\n\\nI was very happy with the product and the simplicity of the e-sign process, but I cannot recommend this to others as I believe their marketing is confusing and non-transparent. When I signed up for a subscription, all the marketing material promised unlimited signatures. However, be sure you read the ENTIRE terms and conditions. The account subscriptions are actually limited to only 100 envelopes per year. In other words, they consider documents you send out to be signed as \"envelopes\" and \"signatures\" are only when you personally sign something. Basically, the service I thought I was receiving was a simple way to send unlimited documents to customers for review and execution for about $25 a month. Instead, I found this to be a program that charges $3 per document ($300 annual subscription for 100 envelopes) and then hits you with a huge price increase. Definitely not what I was expecting...\\n\\n488 people found this review helpful\\n\\nDocuSign\\n\\nNovember 21, 2021\\n\\nHi there.

It doesn\\'t import previous addressees like the online version does, but the browser version pushes you to the app if you\\'re on mobile. Right now I have to send a picture of a document to get it signed because the app won\\'t load any documents at all. I can\\'t even tell you how often this app fails to notify me of a signature, either. Bad app.\\n\\n31 people found this review helpful\\n\\nThe process of creating a box, typing in a box, then dragging said box to fit the line of which you want the text to fill is overly inconvenient. That is one star. The ease of access that comes with doing something digitally is nonexistent. But at least it saves the trees as the app reminds us. One more star. Please make it auto detect where lines are at on a document\\n\\n63 people found this review helpful\\n\\nI was very happy with the product and the simplicity of the e-sign process, but I cannot recommend this to others as I believe their marketing is confusing and non-transparent. When I signed up for a subscription, all the marketing material promised unlimited signatures. However, be sure you read the ENTIRE terms and conditions. The account subscriptions are actually limited to only 100 envelopes per year. In other words, they consider documents you send out to be signed as \"envelopes\" and \"signatures\" are only when you personally sign something. Basically, the service I thought I was receiving was a simple way to send unlimited documents to customers for review and execution for about $25 a month. Instead, I found this to be a program that charges $3 per document ($300 annual subscription for 100 envelopes) and then hits you with a huge price increase. Definitely not what I was expecting...\\n\\n488 people found this review helpful\\n\\nDocuSign\\n\\nNovember 21, 2021\\n\\nHi there.
