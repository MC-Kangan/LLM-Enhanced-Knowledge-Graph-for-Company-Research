It will not only help you collect charges but also offer a smooth experience to your beta customers - your future brand advocates. So let\\'s get the most basic layer right!\\n\\n*   **Price your beta**\\n    \\n    It\\'s fundamental to identify which type of customer is going to help you grow, and optimize your price for them. You\\'ll need to identify your value metric. The perfect metric is one that aligns with your customers\\' needs, grows with them, and is easy to understand.\\n    \\n*   **Collect online payments**\\n    \\n    It\\'s a challenge by itself to get customers to use your product while starting out. \"What is the easiest way for my customer to pay?\" is all you need to be concerned with. With Chargebee, you can control the entire checkout process and provide your customers a seamless billing experience.\\n    \\n*   **Choose your payment gateway**\\n    \\n    It\\'s important that you support a well trusted payment gateway. This gives your customers faith that the transaction is secured and their payment details are in safe hands. [Chargebee supports 30+ of such payment gateways to help you start processing payments](https://www.chargebee.com/payment-gateways/)\\n    .\\n    \\n*   **Generate recurring invoices**\\n    \\n    By making future payments automatic, customers no longer have to log in to their accounts for each billing cycle. Chargebee can help you customize invoices, issue credits, and also send reminders to your customers. This also helps you have a more predictable cash flow.\\n    \\n*   **Use Chargebee with**\\n    \\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/zapier-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/mailchip.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/slack-logo.svg)\\n    \\n\\n#### Establishing Market ($100k - $700k)\\n\\nYour product is scaling! You already have some customers using your product and there\\'s recurring revenue flowing in. Now is the perfect time for you to revisit your pricing with your now established(ing?) market.\\n\\n*   **Let\\'s experiment with pricing**\\n    \\n    What your customers are willing to pay for a product may be vastly less (or more) than what you are charging. This is why it\\'s crucial to understand what consumers value about your product and configure plans and pricing accordingly. With Chargebee, you can manage subscriptions across the whole lifecycle — trials, activation, upgrade/downgrade.\\n    \\n*   **Delight your customers with discounts**\\n    \\n    Psychologically, the term \\'COUPON\\' creates happiness. Customers find delight and joy in receiving an exclusive offer. Get creative with your discounts, especially when many businesses are looking for new services. Build effective discount and coupon campaigns , track them, and drive more revenue. [Here\\'s a collection of customer stories on how Chargebee has helped run effective coupon campaigns](https://www.chargebee.com/blog/how-chargebee-uncomplicates-saas-coupons-and-discounting/)\\n    \\n*   **Provide a customer portal**\\n    \\n    Let your customers manage their accounts, upgrade/downgrade, update payment information, download invoices, apply coupons etc without having to reach out to you every single time. This reduces friction and also a whole bunch of support emails that could come your way.\\n    \\n*   **Get the business context**\\n    \\n    Analytics and tracking are crucial for a business and are distinctive for a subscription business. Chargebee analytics gives you a 360° business visibility on subscription analytics. The analytics module has more than 150+ ready-made reports that helps you derive actionable insights on new sales, payments collected, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), activations, churn and so on. It associates your product metrics with revenue metrics and customer behaviour thereby facilitating the growth of your business.\\n    \\n*   **Use Chargebee with**\\n    \\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/quickbooks-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/logo-black-white.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/pipedrive-full-logo-dark.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/salesforce.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/intercom-logo-horizontal-black.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/baremetrics-logo.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/chartmogul-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/hubspotlogo-web-black.svg)\\n    \\n\\n#### The Final Mile to Your First Million ($700k - $1M)\\n\\nThis is the last but crucial leg to your first Million. Rapid external growth is impossible without getting your internal structures organized beforehand. So let\\'s...\\n\\n*   **Minimize revenue leakage**\\n    \\n    Getting your invoices paid on time means better revenue predictability and cleaner investor reports. And for that, you need to ensure two aspects run like clockwork: Charging when your customers should be charged and exactly for what they use. With Chargebee, you can adjust your customer\\'s bill amount to reflect any plan changes in the middle of the billing cycle, effortlessly.\\n    \\n*   **Expand in territory and revenue**\\n    \\n    At this stage, you are likely to have customers from different parts of the planet, and asking them to pay in just one currency, doesn\\'t quite cut it. Be armed with the best competitive advantage while scaling your business. From hassle-free global currency support to tailoring an entire billing experience to their local language, Chargebee takes customer experience up a notch.\\n    \\n*   **Don\\'t forget the taxes**\\n    \\n    Tax regulations are evolving globally.

It will not only help you collect charges but also offer a smooth experience to your beta customers - your future brand advocates. So let\\'s get the most basic layer right!\\n\\n*   **Price your beta**\\n    \\n    It\\'s fundamental to identify which type of customer is going to help you grow, and optimize your price for them. You\\'ll need to identify your value metric. The perfect metric is one that aligns with your customers\\' needs, grows with them, and is easy to understand.\\n    \\n*   **Collect online payments**\\n    \\n    It\\'s a challenge by itself to get customers to use your product while starting out. \"What is the easiest way for my customer to pay?\" is all you need to be concerned with. With Chargebee, you can control the entire checkout process and provide your customers a seamless billing experience.\\n    \\n*   **Choose your payment gateway**\\n    \\n    It\\'s important that you support a well trusted payment gateway. This gives your customers faith that the transaction is secured and their payment details are in safe hands. [Chargebee supports 30+ of such payment gateways to help you start processing payments](https://www.chargebee.com/payment-gateways/)\\n    .\\n    \\n*   **Generate recurring invoices**\\n    \\n    By making future payments automatic, customers no longer have to log in to their accounts for each billing cycle. Chargebee can help you customize invoices, issue credits, and also send reminders to your customers. This also helps you have a more predictable cash flow.\\n    \\n*   **Use Chargebee with**\\n    \\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/zapier-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/mailchip.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/slack-logo.svg)\\n    \\n\\n#### Establishing Market ($100k - $700k)\\n\\nYour product is scaling! You already have some customers using your product and there\\'s recurring revenue flowing in. Now is the perfect time for you to revisit your pricing with your now established(ing?) market.\\n\\n*   **Let\\'s experiment with pricing**\\n    \\n    What your customers are willing to pay for a product may be vastly less (or more) than what you are charging. This is why it\\'s crucial to understand what consumers value about your product and configure plans and pricing accordingly. With Chargebee, you can manage subscriptions across the whole lifecycle — trials, activation, upgrade/downgrade.\\n    \\n*   **Delight your customers with discounts**\\n    \\n    Psychologically, the term \\'COUPON\\' creates happiness. Customers find delight and joy in receiving an exclusive offer. Get creative with your discounts, especially when many businesses are looking for new services. Build effective discount and coupon campaigns , track them, and drive more revenue. [Here\\'s a collection of customer stories on how Chargebee has helped run effective coupon campaigns](https://www.chargebee.com/blog/how-chargebee-uncomplicates-saas-coupons-and-discounting/)\\n    \\n*   **Provide a customer portal**\\n    \\n    Let your customers manage their accounts, upgrade/downgrade, update payment information, download invoices, apply coupons etc without having to reach out to you every single time. This reduces friction and also a whole bunch of support emails that could come your way.\\n    \\n*   **Get the business context**\\n    \\n    Analytics and tracking are crucial for a business and are distinctive for a subscription business. Chargebee analytics gives you a 360° business visibility on subscription analytics. The analytics module has more than 150+ ready-made reports that helps you derive actionable insights on new sales, payments collected, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), activations, churn and so on. It associates your product metrics with revenue metrics and customer behaviour thereby facilitating the growth of your business.\\n    \\n*   **Use Chargebee with**\\n    \\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/quickbooks-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/logo-black-white.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/pipedrive-full-logo-dark.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/salesforce.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/intercom-logo-horizontal-black.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/baremetrics-logo.svg)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/chartmogul-logo.png)\\n    *   ![](https://webstatic.chargebee.com/assets/web/670/images/launch/growthpage/hubspotlogo-web-black.svg)\\n    \\n\\n#### The Final Mile to Your First Million ($700k - $1M)\\n\\nThis is the last but crucial leg to your first Million. Rapid external growth is impossible without getting your internal structures organized beforehand. So let\\'s...\\n\\n*   **Minimize revenue leakage**\\n    \\n    Getting your invoices paid on time means better revenue predictability and cleaner investor reports. And for that, you need to ensure two aspects run like clockwork: Charging when your customers should be charged and exactly for what they use. With Chargebee, you can adjust your customer\\'s bill amount to reflect any plan changes in the middle of the billing cycle, effortlessly.\\n    \\n*   **Expand in territory and revenue**\\n    \\n    At this stage, you are likely to have customers from different parts of the planet, and asking them to pay in just one currency, doesn\\'t quite cut it. Be armed with the best competitive advantage while scaling your business. From hassle-free global currency support to tailoring an entire billing experience to their local language, Chargebee takes customer experience up a notch.\\n    \\n*   **Don\\'t forget the taxes**\\n    \\n    Tax regulations are evolving globally. With customers from all around the world, paying in different currencies, it\\'s hard to keep up with newer changes made effective every passing year. So let Chargebee manage taxes for you, while you can focus on reaching your milestone, which you\\'re just a few steps away from, at this stage.\\n    \\n*   **Recover revenue smartly:**\\n    \\n    Common reasons like credit card expiry, blocked cards, network issues, and declines due to insufficient funds often come to a customers\\' notice only when their card statement comes in.

      "\n",
      "### What are the main features of a B2B eCommerce marketplace platform?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many features and functions to a B2B eCommerce platform that work to increase efficiencies and reduce business risk. But, the most successful B2B marketplace platforms all have one thing in common — they understand the competitive advantage they provide and implement the most cutting-edge digital tools to maintain it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the world of business can vary greatly, most of the best functions of B2B eCommerce marketplaces are similar across most platforms. At the base is the desire to create an enjoyable experience built on ease-of-use and strategic advantages that help you get ahead of your competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are certain key functions you need to keep in mind when choosing which B2B eCommerce platform to trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Six criteria to look for in a B2B eCommerce marketplace platform:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Multi-vendor capabilities** — a key function of a good B2B marketplace solution is that it allows you to control your company page and information. You should have access to manage your profile, content information, contact details, pricing pages, and your team’s role management.\n",
      "2.  **Self-service functions** — it’s often the case that individuals prefer to place orders themselves rather than have to interact with customer service representatives. Therefore, a solid B2B eCommerce marketplace has features that enable this self-service model if companies choose to do so. B2B marketplaces need to be highly responsive and intuitive to create an enjoyable user experience. For example, when buyers seek out solutions for their business, they often have to ask for quotes, submit orders, or track shipments – the B2B marketplace you choose should support these functions.\n",
      "3.  **Information security functions** — just like with any digital platform, data and information security and confidentiality are essential for organizations to feel secure and comfortable using the platform. Ensure that the B2B marketplace you choose places emphasis on protecting your private information so that you don’t need to worry about data breaches.\n",
      "4.  **Easy-to-use search navigation** — a key aspect to a B2B eCommerce Marketplace is the ability to filter and search for specific vendors and businesses. The right marketplace platform has easy-to-use search functions that enable you to filter sellers by brand, price range, and product availability quickly and accurately.\n",
      "5.  **Fast, flexible workflows** — flexibility and speed needs to be a cornerstone of your B2B marketplace. We’ve all seen how quickly markets and industries can change, and your eCommerce functions need to be able to adapt alongside them. Buyers and sellers need to be able to rely on a flexible and customizable platform that allows them to personalize onboarding strategies, change order submission and processing practices, and replenish supplies when necessary,\n",
      "6.  **Integration options** — the best technologies can work alongside your existing apps and tools. Make sure that you find a B2B eCommerce marketplace with functions that seamlessly collaborate with any other software solutions your organization uses. This leads to a more streamlined process and a better experience for both buyers and sellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What are the advantages of using a B2B eCommerce Marketplace?\n",
      "\n",
      "A B2B marketplace can be a powerful resource for organizations looking to transform and optimize their business processes. With the support of a B2B eCommerce platform, companies can streamline their business functions and interact with like-minded organizations to quickly grow their businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "By reducing your marketing costs, you can focus your efforts on securing larger orders and growing your bottom line. Some common advantages you’ll gain from utilizing a B2B eCommerce marketplace include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **User-friendly solution** — B2B marketplaces make it easier than ever for organizations to connect with other companies and conduct business. With a fully digital online platform, our [B2B Marketplace](https://tradeshift.com/supply-chain-solutions/buy/)\n",

And, with digitization and automation being a priority for most forward-thinking organizations, implementing B2B software that supports virtual and secure business transactions will help you get ahead of your competitors.\n",
      "*   **Higher profit margins**— typically, B2B businesses sell their products at a wholesale price, incentivizing bulk orders. These larger order quantities mean that businesses can secure higher levels of revenue faster. With so many buyers and sellers on the same [B2B eCommerce](https://tradeshift.com/supply-chain-solutions/buy/)\n",
      "     platform, you can cut spending on marketing because it’s easier to connect with, and advertise your product to other companies.\n",
      "*   **Better sense of security** — many orders through B2B eCommerce marketplaces are conducted through pre-established contracts. This grants a sense of security to both buyers and sellers because both parties are much more inclined to follow through on their promises. What’s more, many B2B platforms are fully digital, meaning that there is a digital trail for each order that you can track and monitor along the way. This gives you peace of mind in that you have a transparent view of the entire process, from order placement to invoice processing.\n",
      "*   **Greater market potential** — [B2B marketplace platforms](https://tradeshift.com/supply-chain-solutions/buy/)\n",

It may take plenty of research and exhaustive work to understand how to appeal to customers on the marketplace, and getting to the point where orders are consistent enough and large-scale enough to support your business functions may take some time.\n",
      "*   **Most B2B eCommerce marketplace solutions are expensive** — in most cases, organizations may face an expensive and time-consuming process when gaining your first initial leads on the marketplace platform. This means that you may have to factor in high costs for marketing budgets in addition to the cost of joining the network.\n",
      "*   **Highly competitive** — Online B2B marketplaces are competitive landscapes by their very nature. With thousands of buyers and sellers all in one place, the competition can be tough. On any given day, there are numerous businesses offering similar solutions as your own, so finding a way to be unique and stand out to buyers is critical.\n",
      "*   **Limited sales** — B2B businesses can have very high levels of sales, but by their nature, the available pool of consumers on an eCommerce platform is somewhat limited. When you take individual consumers out of the equation, it reduces the number of potential buyers you can advertise your products and services to. What’s more, is that with high competition for B2B sales, negotiations and contracts can put a restriction on your profit margin.\n",
