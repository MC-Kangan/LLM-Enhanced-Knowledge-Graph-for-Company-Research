      "Individual Investors\n",
      "> I took $105M of my funds and invested with a prominent investment firm (big trust company).  Within 10 months they lost $11M (on 1,100 stock trades and investing in long-term bonds at low rates)…this did not fit my guidance of protecting my principle and maintaining a low risk. My belief was let the big boys manage it and take some time off after a 45-year career. MISTAKE! Incompetence can be wrapped in a very pretty package. I took over the account on January 14, 2023.  \n",
      "> Since that time (and with your tool), I have made my money back with reduced risk.  I sold off their bad stuff, kept the good stuff and bought new stuff.  \n",
      "> The stocks I sold off had a 5.12% return (had I held them), the stocks I kept had an 18.08% return and the stocks I purchased (see below) had a 10.32% return (annualized 20.4% return).  \n",
      "> These were my purchases based on your tools and my additional research… I think this tells the story about your tool! I was skeptical, but results have given me confidence.\n",
      "> John\n",
      "> It has saved me large amounts of capital by preventing me from entering into a position I thought was a risk worth taking, but forced me to take another look at through its rating process.\n",
      "> Steven Crews\n",
      "> It provides me with concise insights into investment opportunities derived from meaningful metrics that I couldn't duplicate on my own.\n",
      "> David Marshall\n",
      "> New Constructs provides a credible rating system.\n",
      "> Ralph Young\n",
      "> Simply and instantly, you can see how your stocks or funds are rated and where they are trading compared to economic book value.  For someone with limited time to spend ‘watching’ the stock market, this top-down view is incredibly useful. I highly endorse the NewConstructs system as one ‘must have’ tool in any stock or fund selection system.\n",
      "> Joe Petrone\n",
      "> When I buy a stock rated by New Constructs, I am reasonably sure--nothing is perfect-- that the stock has intrinsic value and reasonable prospects to retain that value, regardless of the value assigned by the market at a particular point in time.  New Constructs is the most complete and consistent analysis available to me, and it has made me a more confident and successful investor.\n",
      "> Jeffrey T.\n",
      "> Best technical and financial analysis I've found. New Constructs ratings are a key factor in my evaluation of new purchases as well as hold or sell.\n",
      "> Individual Day Trader\n",
      "> I don’t feel that I was investing correctly before New Constructs — and my results have certainly improved ever since. If you look at how to value stocks — you look at Benjamin Graham and the way he thought about valuing companies. Who’s doing that kind of stuff now? It’s New Constructs.\n",
      "> Individual\n",
      "> It provides another set of eyes on the financials of company's of interest. It also provides education about financial statements in an easy to comprehend and informative manner.\n",
      "> New Constructs provides unbiased data free from commercial hype.\n",
      "> Individual Fundamental Investor\n",
      "> It's simply too time consuming and confusing to go through and understand filing documents to pick good companies to invest in. Almost impossible given the amount of information. New Constructs' summaries and research articles are factual, meaningful and easy to understand.\n",
      "> Jonathan Chuan\n",
      "Wealth Advisors\n",
      "> Love the service, period. Think David and the rest of the team have been and continue to do a good job and provide a valuable service.\n",
      "> Joe Musumeci, Raymond James\n",
      "> My CEO and Accountant clients are impressed with me using New Constructs as part of my research team. They tell me that the edge I get from NC is the main reason they deal with me and send me referrals. How can you invest without a deep dive into the financials?\n",
      "> Charles Wilton, Raymond James\n",
      "> Who do you trust? Stock promotors? Everybody's got an angle. So far to date New Constructs has provided me with more facts than fiction.\n",
      "> Rob Austin, Austin Holdings\n",
      "> New Constructs helps me keep 34% more of my advisory fees every month by reducing my costs. Knowing that I have a partner in New Constructs that I can trust for diligence makes all the difference in the world to me and to my clients.\n",
      "> Mike Irvin\n",
      "> I feel much more comfortable knowing that New Constructs is providing an additional layer of due diligence to my research by analyzing footnotes and making adjustments to the true economic earnings. New Constructs help me clearly see if a company is truly creating value for its shareholders.\n",
      "> Brady Raanes, Raanes Capital Management\n",
      "> As the owner of a small RIA, I need to manage my time and costs. New Constructs addresses both. Their application of machine learning gives me much more confidence than what I read from the sell side. I particularly appreciate their in-depth Long Ideas that flesh out how best to use ROIC and economic earnings. Add in their helpful and educational client support, and it’s a no-brainer to sign up.\n",
      "> RIA Owner\n",
      "> I understand my firm has a relationship with other companies, and they do business with those companies, so having New Constructs giving me a comfort and a second check on due diligence and my recommendations is invaluable. I would highly recommend making New Constructs part of your business.\n",
      "> Professional Wealth Manager\n",
      "> Saves me from having to scrub data for ROIC calculation. Sell side research lacks consistency of approach across firms and analysts within firms.\n",
      "> Wealth Advisor\n",
      "> New Constructs provides a more in-depth analysis of the accounting practices of the companies I follow for my clients.\n",
      "> Certified Financial Planner\n",
      "Institutional Investors\n",
      "> Corporate bonds comprise a substantial portion of our portfolio.  New Constructs reports, tools, and data are key to our successful management.  We use their screeners to identify investment candidates and integrate their metrics into our internal credit analyses via API and excel add-ins.  Most important though, is the quality of their analysis, helping us to identify and avoid companies that fail to deliver economic value.  They have been a trusted partner for many years, in a relationship we hope to continue well into the future.\n",
      "> Portfolio Manager of a Multi-Billion Dollar Fixed Income Portfolio\n",
      "> With HOLT and AFG, data from the financial statements isn’t nearly as complete as it is with New Constructs. The New Constructs approach is much more effective than other systems available on the market today.\n",
      "> John Healy\n",
      "> The New Constructs staff does the detailed analysis of public filings and creates reports and valuations that I would not have the time to do.\n",
      "> Robert Brammer, Brammer Technology\n",
      "> New Constructs provides the ability to screen stocks based on economic earnings, ROIC and EV. We can't build models on hundreds (or thousands) of stocks.\n",
